# BYOI: Bring Your Own Identity

**BYOI** (Bring Your Own Identity) is a modern passwordless authentication system that gives users ownership over their identity across the web. It combines the power of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using the ION method with seamless biometric authentication via WebAuthn — delivered through a sleek browser extension and a plug-and-play SDK for developers.

---

## 🔍 Why BYOI?

Traditional authentication systems — username-password combinations, social login, or centralized OAuth providers — suffer from major drawbacks:

- **Centralized control** over user identities
- **Password fatigue** and poor security hygiene
- **Vendor lock-in** for developers
- **Privacy violations** through third-party tracking
- **High friction** in cross-platform or multi-device identity portability

BYOI redefines user authentication by addressing these issues with a self-sovereign, interoperable, and developer-friendly system.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

- ### 🔐 **Browser Extension (User Agent)**
  - Acts as the user-owned identity wallet
  - Locally generates and stores ION DIDs and cryptographic keys
  - Authenticates users via device biometrics (WebAuthn)
  - Responds to authentication requests initiated by websites

- ### 🧰 **SDK (Developer Toolkit)**
  - Allows websites to easily integrate BYOI login flows
  - Sends requests to the extension and verifies signed responses
  - Abstracts DID communication and WebAuthn complexities
