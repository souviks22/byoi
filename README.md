**BYOI** (Bring Your Own Identity) is a modern, passwordless authentication system that gives users **full control** over their identity across the web. It uses **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** with the [ION](https://identity.foundation/ion/) method and **biometric authentication** via [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/), delivered through:

* A sleek **browser extension**
* A plug-and-play **SDK for developers**

---

## üîç Why BYOI?

Traditional login systems (e.g., passwords, social logins, OAuth) are flawed:

* üîê **Centralized control** over user identities
* üò© **Password fatigue** and weak password reuse
* üß± **Vendor lock-in** for developers
* üëÄ **Privacy violations** through third-party tracking
* üì± **Lack of portability** across devices or platforms

**BYOI** solves these with a self-sovereign, secure, and privacy-preserving system.

---

## üß† Core Architecture

### üîê Browser Extension (User Agent)

* Acts as the **user-owned identity wallet**
* Locally creates and stores **ION DIDs** and **cryptographic keys**
* Authenticates users via **device-native biometrics** (WebAuthn)
* Handles authentication requests initiated by websites

### üß∞ SDK (Developer Toolkit)

* Simple integration of BYOI login into web apps
* Sends authentication requests to the extension
* Verifies signed responses
* Abstracts DID resolution and WebAuthn under the hood
